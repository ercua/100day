fadesadfNext + Netlify Starter
Netlify Status

This is a Next.js v12 project bootstrapped with create-next-app and set up to be instantly deployed to Netlify!

This project is a very minimal starter that includes 2 sample components, a global stylesheet, a netlify.toml for deployment, and a jsconfig.json for setting up absolute imports and aliases. It also includes the Essential Next.js Build Plugin, which will allow for you to implement features like Preview Mode, server-side rendering/incremental static regeneration via Netlify Functions, and internationalized routing.

Deploy to Netlify

(If you click this button, it will create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify)

Getting Started
First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Installation options
Option one: One-click deploy

Deploy to Netlify

Option two: Manual clone

Clone this repo: git clone https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-netlify-starter.git
Navigate to the directory and run npm install
Run npm run dev
Make your changes
Connect to Netlify manually (the netlify.toml file is the one you'll need to make sure stays intact to make sure the export is done and pointed to the right stuff)
